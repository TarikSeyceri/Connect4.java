# Connect4.java
(Connect4 or 4Win) This project is a game developed in three versions, C, C++ &amp; Java SE, older to newer respect

This version is written in Java SE Programing Language (With GUI) in 2013,

it was for my fourth semester project in uni

i was a beginner so please don't judge my programming standards.

i published it to give any freshman programmer a dose of encouragement, self-trust & programming help to write a game.

i used Eclipse IDE for Windows

Java IDE for Windows, Linux or MacOSX from here:
